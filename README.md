# MovieNight

To practice code and continue learning post grad, I'm teaching myself Flutter. I took a [mobile development course](https://github.com/n0ahth0mas/AIT_ANDROID) two semesters ago that focused on Android development with Kotlin, and I wanted to take this interest one step further with Flutter. I'll be updating this as I go!
